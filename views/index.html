            <b>Blockchain Technology</b>
            <br/>
            <br/> A blockchain is a type of distributed ledger, comprised of unchangeable, digitally recorded data in packages called blocks. These digitally recorded "blocks" of data is stored in a linear chain. Each block in the chain contains data (e.g. bitcoin transaction), is cryptographically hashed. The blocks of hashed data draw upon the previous-block (which came before it) in the chain, ensuring all data in the overall "blockchain" has not been tampered with and remains unchanged

                <h2><b>Address</b></h2>
                <p>Addresses (Cryptocurrency addresses) are used to receive and send transactions on the network. An address is a string
                  of alphanumeric characters, but can also be represented as a scannable QR code. </p>

                <p>An agreement ledger is distributed ledger used by two or more parties to negotiate and reach agreement. </p>

                <h2><b>API</b></h2>
                <p>API stands for application programming interface. It is a set of requirements that dictate how two pieces of software talk to each other. It is basically what allows you to move data between applications. </p>

                <h2><b>Attestation Ledger</b></h2>
                <p>A distributed ledger providing a durable record of agreements, commitments or statements, providing evidence (attestation)

                <h2><b>ASIC</b></h2>
                <p>ASIC is an acronym for "Application Specific Integrated Circuit". ASICs are silicon chips specifically designed to
                  do a single task. In the case of bitcoin, they are designed to process SHA-256 hashing problems to mine new bitcoins.

                <p>A relatively new term for 2016, coined by William Mougayar of Virtual Capital Ventures in early 2015. It means Blockchain-as-a-Service. Equivalent terms include Ethereum Blockchain-as-a-Service (EthBaaS), or “Blockchain-as-a-Platform” (BaaP). It refers to the growing landscape of services based around blockchain technology. The best example of this we have so far is Microsoft launching its own EthBaaS on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform this year. This platform will allow companies to begin working with blockchain technology without having to first make significant investments in hardware.</p>

                  packages called blocks (rather like collating them on to a single sheet of paper). Each block is then ‘chained’ to
                  the next block, using a cryptographic signature. This allows block chains to be used like a ledger, which can be
                  shared and accessed by anyone with the appropriate permissions.<br />

                <h2><b>Block Height</b></h2>
                <p itemprop="description">Block height refers to the number of blocks connected together in the block chain. For example, <i>Height 0</i>, would

                  known as mining, in a proof-of-work system (e.g. Bitcoin). Once a transaction is <i>confirmed</i>, it cannot be reversed
                  or double spent. The more confirmations a transaction has, the harder it becomes to perform a double spend attack.<br

                <p itemprop="description">A point – either in time, or defined in terms of a set number or volume of records to be added to the ledger – where

                <h2><b>Crowdfunding</b></h2>
                <p>There are two types of crowdfunding: rewards-based crowdfunding and equity-based crowdfunding. The first relates to platforms like Kickstarter or Indiegogo, where startups raise pledges and in return offer buy-in incentives for anything they produce. Equity crowdfunding is a more recent phenomenon where pledgers are actually investors that receive a small share in the business in return for their contributions.</p>

                <p itemprop="description">Difficulty, in Proof-of-Work mining, is how hard it is to verify blocks in a blockchain network. In the Bitcoin network,
                  the difficulty of mining adjusts verifying blocks every 2016 blocks. This is to keep block verification time at ten

                <h2><b>Double Spend</b></h2>

                  different recipients at the same time. However, once a bitcoin transaction is confirmed, it makes it nearly impossible
                  to double spend it. The more confirmations that a particular transaction has, the harder it becomes to double spend
                  the bitcoins.<br />

                <h2><b>Permissioned Ledger</b></h2>
                <p itemprop="description">A permissioned ledger is a ledger where actors must have permission to access the ledger. Permissioned ledgers may
                  have one or many owners. When a new record is added, the ledger’s integrity is checked by a limited consensus process.
                  This is carried out by trusted actors — government departments or banks, for example — which makes maintaining a
                  shared record much simpler that the consensus process used by unpermissioned ledgers. Permissioned block chains provide
                  highly-verifiable data sets because the consensus process creates a digital signature, which can be seen by all parties.
                  A permissioned ledger is usually faster than an unpermissioned ledger.<br />

                <h2><b>Proof-of-Work</b></h2>
                <p itemprop="description">A system that ties mining capability to computational power. Blocks must be hashed, which is in itself an easy computational
                  process, but an additional variable is added to the hashing process to make it more difficult. When a block is successfully
                  hashed, the hashing must have taken some time and computational effort. Thus, a hashed block is considered proof
