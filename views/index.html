            <p>Supply chain finance is a set of technology-based business and financing processes that link the various parties in a transaction

              With interest rates bottoming and the market jittery, treasurers are seeking more unconventional and versatile means for
              managing stockpiled war chests of liquidity. Treasurers face myriad challenges when it comes to managing their
              organizations’ liquidity. Even though markets are now awash with cheap liquidity as the economic crisis of
              2007–2008 recedes, economic uncertainty still lingers across many corners of the globe. And as companies conduct
              more business cross-border, they are increasingly vulnerable to market instability. To read more, Please visit:

              Blockchain, the Cloud and the Internet of Things are luring trade finance away from its reliance on paper. Trade finance
              is one area of commercial banking that historically has proven resistant to technological innovations. “It’s

                In Developing Technology, Banks Go Back To Basics
              </h3>
              Amid the surge in global trade, financial institutions are revisiting the way they conduct transaction banking. Technological
              innovations like distributed ledgers may be rocketing financial institutions into the future. But Lisa Robins,
              a managing director and the regional head of global transaction banking, Asia-Pacific, at Deutsche Bank, says
              the renewed attention the industry is paying to transaction banking “is taking us back to our origins—focusing
              specifically on the needs of customers and organizing to meet those needs.” To read more, Please visit:

						<b>Blockchain Technology</b>
						<br/>
						<br/> A blockchain is a type of distributed ledger, comprised of unchangeable, digitally recorded data in packages called blocks. These digitally recorded "blocks" of data is stored in a linear chain. Each block in the chain contains data (e.g. bitcoin
						transaction), is cryptographically hashed. The blocks of hashed data draw upon the previous-block (which came before it) in the chain, ensuring all data in the overall "blockchain" has not been tampered with and remains unchanged

                <h2><b>BaaS</b></h2>
                <p>A relatively new term for 2016, coined by William Mougayar of Virtual Capital Ventures in early 2015. It means Blockchain-as-a-Service. Equivalent terms include Ethereum Blockchain-as-a-Service (EthBaaS), or “Blockchain-as-a-Platform” (BaaP). It refers to the growing landscape of services based around blockchain technology. The best example of this we have so far is Microsoft launching its own EthBaaS on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform this year. This platform will allow companies to begin working with blockchain technology without having to first make significant investments in hardware.</p>

                <p itemprop="description">The well known cryptocurrency, based on the proof-of-work blockchain.<br />
                </p>

                <h2><b>bitcoin (lowercase)</b></h2>
                <p itemprop="description">The specific collection of technologies used by Bitcoin’s ledger, a particular solution. Note that the currency is
                  itself one of these technologies, as it provides the miners with the incentive to mine. <br />
                </p>

                <h2><b>Bitcoin Mining</b></h2>
                <p itemprop="description">Bitcoin mining is the process by which transactions are verified and added to the public ledger, known as the block chain, and also the means through which new bitcoin are released.  Anyone with access to the internet and suitable hardware can participate in mining.  The mining process involves compiling recent transactions into blocks and trying to solve a computationally difficult puzzle.  The participant who first solves the puzzle gets to place the next block on the block chain and claim the rewards.  The rewards, which incentivize mining, are both the transaction fees associated with the transactions compiled in the block as well as newly released bitcoin.<br />
                </p>

                <h2><b>Block</b></h2>
                <p itemprop="description">A block refers to a large order of the same security to be bought or sold by institutional or other large investors. There is no official size designation constituting a block of securities, but a commonly used threshold is more than 10,000 equity shares, or a total market value of more than $200,000.<br />
                </p>

                <h2><b>Blocked Fund Letters (BFL)</b></h2>
                <p itemprop="description">In cases where a fraudster has enticed an investor into a bogus scheme where the invested funds remain on deposit earning interest in the investor’s bank, the investor is told to obtain a blocked fund letter (BFL) from his bank. This letter promises to pay funds from the victim’s account to the holder of the letter. The fraudster, often with the help of a third party such as a lawyer, obtains control of the BFL which he uses as collateral to get a loan at a bank of his choice. The fraudster can then default on the loan and flee. Under the BFL the issuing bank must pay the lending bank and the victim loses his money. However, the banking community does not recognISe BFLs as banking instruments and they should not be issued by banks or accepted as collateral.<br />
                </p>

                <h2><b>Blockchain</b></h2>
                <p itemprop="description">A blockchain is a type of distributed ledger, comprised of unchangable, digitally recorded data in
                  packages called blocks (rather like collating them on to a single sheet of paper). Each block is then ‘chained’ to
                  the next block, using a cryptographic signature. This allows block chains to be used like a ledger, which can be
                  shared and accessed by anyone with the appropriate permissions.<br />
                </p>

                <h2><b>Block Height</b></h2>
                <p itemprop="description">Block height refers to the number of blocks connected together in the block chain. For example, <i>Height 0</i>, would
                  be the very first block, which is also called the <i>Genesis Block</i>.<br />
                </p>

                <h2><b>Block House</b></h2>
                <p itemprop="description">A brokerage firm with the primary focus of locating potential buyers and sellers of large trades. A block house typically deals with institutional clients rather than individual investors, since each transaction represents millions of dollars. Examples of institutional clients include mutual funds and pension funds that assume significant security positions. Because of the nature of block house firms, their trading activity can have a considerable effect on the financial markets. Block trades are generally considered to be those dealing with more than 10,000 shares of stock (excluding penny stocks), or any other trade that involves a high monetary value.<br/>
                </p>

                <h2><b>Block Positioner</b></h2>
                <p itemprop="description">A securities dealer who will take a long or short position in order to accommodate a seller or buyer of a large block of securities. The dealer takes on the risk of the securities in order to help clear the trade for the seller. Block positioners aim to unload the position quickly, and typically hedge their risk with options or by selling the securities short.<br/>
                </p>

                <h2><b>Block Reward</b></h2>
                <p itemprop="description">The reward given to a miner which has successfully hashed a transaction block. Block rewards can be a mixture of coins
                  and transaction fees, depending on the policy used by the cryptocurrency in question, and whether all of the coins
                  have already been successfully mined. The current block reward for the Bitcoin network is 25 bitcoins for each block.<br/>
                </p>

                <h2><b>Block Trade</b></h2>
                <p itemprop="description">A block trade, also known as a block order, is an order or trade submitted for the sale or purchase of a large quantity of securities. A block trade involves a significantly large number of equities or bonds being traded at an arranged price between two parties, sometimes outside of the open markets, to lessen the impact on the security price. In general, 10,000 shares of stock, not including penny stocks, or $200,000 worth of bonds are considered a block trade.<br/>
                </p>

                <h2><b>Block Trading Facility - BTF</b></h2>
                <p itemprop="description">A wholesale trading facility that allows traders to buy or sell large numbers of securities bilaterally outside of the public market. Because trades conducted in a block trading facility are typically between two parties, prices are set with certainty and execution is done without delay. Institutional investors use block trading facilities for transactions involving large numbers of shares.<br/>
                </p>

                <h2><b>Buyer Credit</b></h2>
                <p itemprop="description">A financing arrangement under which a lending bank in the supplier’s country lends directly to the buyer or to a bank in the buyer’s country to enable the buyer to make payments due to the supplier under a contract.<br/>

                  have one or many owners. When a new record is added, the ledger’s integrity is checked by a limited consensus process.
                  This is carried out by trusted actors — government departments or banks, for example — which makes maintaining a
                  shared record much simpler that the consensus process used by unpermissioned ledgers. Permissioned block chains provide
                  highly-verifiable data sets because the consensus process creates a digital signature, which can be seen by all parties.

                  ledger is to allow anyone to contribute data to the ledger and for everyone in possession of the ledger to have identical
                  copies. This creates censorship resistance, which means that no actor can prevent a transaction from being added
                  to the ledger. Participants maintain the integrity of the ledger by reaching a consensus about its state<br />

                <li>distributed</li>
                <li>decentralized (no banks, authority here)</li>
                <li>to create and move tradeable digital tokens representing assets, currency, ownership etc .. </li>
                <li>...across parties sharing a distributed ledger which is immutable and with ability to run Smart Contracts and validate against consensus by Proof-of-work</li><br/>
                <li>Distributed trustable storage provided by BlockChain.</li>
                <li>Distributed trustable calculations provided by Smart Contracts (Code which is executed)</li>
                <li>Computing and mathematics work together to establish transparency, accuracy and trust. </li>
